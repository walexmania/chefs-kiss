Upon learning it was to close, she purchased the restaurant, and in the ensuing years she instilled a gracious and sincere love for serving others. Since then, Via ReÃ¡l has grown into a beautiful, successful establishment known nationwide for its relaxed Santa Fe style and delicious Mexican and Southwestern cuisine."
